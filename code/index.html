	<p1><br>HAL (Heuristically programmed ALgorithmic Computer) 9000 is an 
		artificial intelligence computer which controls the functions of 
		the Discovery One spacecraft. HAL is a very malicious computer who attempts to kill all of the Discovery One's crew after learning of their plot to disconnect HAL from it's cognitive database. The crew's plan to disconnect HAL is foley, and many astronauts lose their lives to this corrupt computer.

		HAL 9000 appears in Stanley Kubrick's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film)">2001: A Space 
		Odyssey</a>, originally based off of Arthur C. Clarke's Space Odyssey 
		series. Kubrick's re-creation of HAL is regarded as one of the greatest
		film villians of all time.  </p2>
